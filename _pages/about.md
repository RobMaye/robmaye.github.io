I hold an MSc in Advanced Computing from Imperial College London, specializing in Machine Learning Engineering and AI consultancy. My research focused on cognitive architecture and multi-agent systems, culminating in [AIversity](https://github.com/aurelio-labs/aiversity), an adaptive learning ecosystem leveraging multi-agent AI for personalized education.

Professionally, I develop sophisticated AI solutions integrating natural language processing, vector search, and conversational AI. Currently contributing to innovative AI projects at [Aurelio](https://www.aurelio.ai/about-us), while also serving as an independent consultant, helping diverse clients harness the power of the latest step changes in AI technology.

My expertise lies in exploring the synergy between AI and human cognition, with a particular interest in swarm intelligence and autonomous multi-agent systems. These technologies represent significant step changes in how we process and interact with information, holding immense potential to transform knowledge work.

Through my work, I aim to bridge the gap between academic research and practical AI applications, driving innovation that delivers tangible impact across industries.

I welcome opportunities for collaboration.
